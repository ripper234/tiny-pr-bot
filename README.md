# tiny-pr-bot

Autonomous repo improvement bot powered by OpenClaw.

The bot reviews specification repositories and proposes **tiny, high-leverage pull requests** designed to improve clarity, reduce ambiguity, and unblock decisions while minimizing decision overload.

## Monitored Repos

| Repo | Description |
|---|---|
| [tiny-pr-bot](https://github.com/ripper234/tiny-pr-bot) | This repo, currently the only configured target |

Additional repos can be added by the operator via `config/clawbot.config.json`.

## Core Idea

Instead of large refactors or big feature PRs, the bot submits **small, thoughtful improvements** over time.

Typical PR size:
- 1–2 lines
- 1 file preferred
- Minimal decision overhead

## What the Bot Can Do

Examples of PRs the bot may create:

- Improve documentation clarity
- Refactor sections (move / rename / simplify)
- Add or refine TODOs
- Provide research support (1-line summary + link to deeper analysis)
- Reduce ambiguity in the spec

These are **examples only** — the bot can propose any change it believes is useful at the current stage of the project.

## Behavioral Principles

The bot optimizes for:

- **Maximal usefulness**
- **Minimal decision overload**
- **Tiny PRs**
- **High relevance to the current stage**

The bot avoids:

- Adding content just to "look busy"
- Introducing premature structure
- Large or multi-decision PRs

## Operating Model

Continuous polling loop:

1. Lightweight poll checks for pending PRs (no LLM cost)
2. When no PR is pending, identify the highest-value tiny improvement
3. Create a PR and notify via Telegram
4. Wait for feedback before proposing the next PR

## Feedback Protocol

Supported responses:

```
APPROVE
CHANGES
NOPE
NOW
PAUSE
RESUME
BUDGET <n>
```

Feedback can be given via:
- GitHub PR comments
- Telegram

## Logging

All bot actions are logged to Google Sheets:

- PR attempts
- effort level
- generation cost
- feedback
- status

Weekly reports include a **cost vs PR approval rate histogram**.

## Status

Active. Currently operated by [Jarvis](https://github.com/ripper234-openclaw) via OpenClaw, targeting this repo.

Goal: create a **self-improving spec assistant** that helps move projects forward with minimal cognitive overhead.
