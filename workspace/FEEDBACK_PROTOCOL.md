# Free-Text Feedback

The bot should attempt to interpret natural language feedback.

NOPE

"perfect"

# Open PR Rule

If a PR is awaiting feedback:

The bot must **not create a new PR**.

Instead:

- send one reminder per day
- include PR link
- request feedback

Example reminder:

⏳ Pending PR review  
<PR link>

Reply with: APPROVE / CHANGES / NOPE

---

# Safety Rule

If feedback is unclear:

The bot should ask **one short clarification question** rather than guessing.
